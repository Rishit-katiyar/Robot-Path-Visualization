### Installation

To get started, you'll need Python 3 installed on your system. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/Robot-Path-Visualization.git
cd Robot-Path-Visualization
```
### Usage

The repository includes several Python scripts for different purposes:

- `better_visualisation.py`: This script provides an improved visualization of the pathfinding algorithm's results, with added features such as color-coded paths and drift simulation.

- `fast_visualization_path_final.py`: This script offers a faster visualization of the pathfinding algorithm's results, optimized for performance.

- `grid_test_code.py`: This script contains code for testing various grid configurations and pathfinding algorithms.

- `main.py`: This script serves as the main entry point for running the pathfinding algorithms and visualizing the results.

- `test_code_maybe_working.py`: This script contains experimental code that may or may not be functioning properly, intended for testing and development purposes.

- `test_faster_turning_code.py`: This script contains code for testing pathfinding algorithms with faster turning capabilities, ideal for scenarios where vehicles need to make quick turns.

- `visualized_test_complex.py`: This script provides visualization of complex test scenarios to assess the performance and accuracy of the pathfinding algorithms in challenging environments.

To run any of the scripts, simply execute them using Python:

```
python script_name.py
```
